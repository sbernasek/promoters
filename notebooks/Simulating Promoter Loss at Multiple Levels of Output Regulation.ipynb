    "In this notebook we will evaluate the change in protein expression dynamics and the frequency of developmental errors induced by losing one of two promoters. Each pair of promoters will be drawn combinatorially from a collection of promoters acting to upregulate the target gene's transcriptional availability, transcript synthesis, and protein synthesis. We will then visualize the resultant change in developmental error frequency under a range of different biosynthesis conditions."
