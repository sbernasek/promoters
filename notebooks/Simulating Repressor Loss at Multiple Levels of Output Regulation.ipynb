    "In this notebook we will evaluate the change in protein expression dynamics and the frequency of developmental errors induced by losing one of two repressors. Each pair of repressors will be drawn combinatorially from a collection of repressors acting to downregulate the target gene's transcription, transcript stability, and protein stability. We will then visualize the resultant change in developmental error frequency under a range of different biosynthesis conditions."
