    "To see how our parameter sweeps are constructed or to attempt to run one on your own computing cluster, interested users may refer to the `build_sweep.py` script in the `promoters/scripts` directory. This script serves as the basis for constructing each of our parameter sweeps. For example, a sweep of the linear model would be generated by executing `python build_sweep.py -m linear -N 5000 -n 2500` at the command line. The `-m` flag denotes the model of interest, e.g. `linear`, `twostate`, or `hill`. The `-N` flag denotes the number of simulated trajectories per parameter set, and the `-n` flag denotes the number of unique parameter sets. Many more optional arguments are provided via the `promoters.execution.arguments` module. Upon execution, the `build_sweep.py` script creates a \"sweep directory\" containing all of the contents necessary to execute the parameter sweep. The sweep directory is named using a combination of the model type and the current date and time, resulting in something similiar to `MODEL_YYMMDD_hhmmss`. For simplicity we have renamed the sweep directories in our completed results."

    "\n",
    "We have provided two separate means of visually summarizing the results of a parameter sweep. These methods provide the user with a high level view of individual simulation outcomes such as error frequency, protein under- and over-expression, or the change in either quantity when metabolic conditions are changed. The approaches are:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Multidimensional Projection\n",
    "Individual simulation outcomes are projected onto 2D planes spanned by paired components of the sampled parameter space. All pairs are visualized, with the projections interpolated onto a continuous surface. This representation helps depict macroscopic trends in simulation outcome as a function of each of the model's key parameters. However, the projection from a high dimensional space onto a 2D grid leads to a very noisy depiction of parameter dependence. Furthermore, this visualization strategy can be cumbersome to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a multidimensional projection, we can initialize the figure using the `Sweep.build_figure` method, which returns a `SweepFigure` instance. The `condition` argument defines the metabolic conditions of interest using a shorthand notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * 'normal': Normal metabolism\n",
    "    * 'diabetic': Reduced energy metabolism\n",
    "    * 'hyper_metabolic': Elevated energy metabolism\n",
    "\n",
    "The `mode` argument defines the outcome of interest (see the definitions in our manuscript). Options are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * 'threshold_error': Frequency of developmental errors \n",
    "    * 'error': Average protein under- or over-expression\n",
    "\n",
    "The `relative` argument determines whether or not the simulation outcomes are expressed as differential values relative to normal metabolic conditions. In other words, if `condition='diabetic'` and `relative=False`, error frequencies under conditions of reduced energy metabolism are displayed directly. If `relative=True`, the difference in error frequency between normal conditions and conditions of reduced energy metabolism are shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then use the `SweepFigure.render` method to visualize the multidimensional projection, subject to a number of formatting parameters."
